        question: "Which students can participate in the program?",
        answer: "The program is mainly targeted towards high school students, but we do have some college students as well. Any student who is in high school (finished grade 9 by the time the program begins) can apply. In some exceptional cases, we have admitted some younger students, but that is rare."
    },{
        question: "Will the program be in-person or virtual?", // "for Summer" + new Date().getFullYear() + "?",
        answer: 'The program will run in hybrid mode. That is, there will be a virtual component and there will be an in-person component that will be held on the UPenn campus in Philadelphia. The tuition for in-person participation will be higher than the tuition for the virtual component.'
    },
    {
        question: "Where does the program take place, if it is in-person?",
        answer: "The University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) campus in Philadelphia." // 'Princeton University, <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/">Computer Science Building</a> (35 Olden Street, Princeton NJ)' // add link //done
    },
    {
        question: "Will accommodations be provided?",
        answer: "We have a limited number of rooms available in Penn dorms for PACT'24 students. Dorm rooms will be assigned on a first-come first-served basis (in the order in which payments are received). Note that Penn requires that students must have finished grade 9 to stay in Penn dorms over the summer. In-person students can however find their own housing too. Note that students who manage their own housing and who are minors (under the age of 18 years) must stay with a parent or must stay with an adult whom the parents of the participant have authorized to be the legal guardian of the participant for the duration of the program."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the residential fee to stay in Penn dorms?",
        answer: "The residential fee to stay in Penn dorms for the duration of the program is $6,375."
    },
    // {
    //     question: "How can students commute to the program?",
    //     answer: 'For those living in North Jersey, commuting via <a href="http://www.njtransit.com/rg/rg_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=LineDetailsTo&selLine=NEC">NJ Transit’s North East Corridor Line</a> is probably the best option.  There are many trains that travel from New York to Princeton Junction in the morning.  Upon arriving at Princeton Junction, students can take the Princeton dinky or a substitute bus to arrive at Princeton Station, which is on campus.  It is then a roughly twenty-minute walk to 35 Olden Street.'

    // {
    //     question: "For students who drive where can they park?",
    //     answer: "There is visitor parking in lot 21 (off faculty road). There is a shuttle service that one can use or one can walk (about a 5-10 minute walk to the CS building). The C- East Commuter shuttle will drop you off right in front of the CS building. The shuttle comes about every 20 mins. There is an app called “rider” you can use to track the shuttles as well. Directions can be found on the Princeton website. There may also some free parking available on Maple street off Nassau (5-minute walk from the CS building), but I am told that one needs to get in early to find a parking spot."

    // {
    //     question: "Will lunch be provided?",
    //     answer: "For in-person students staying in dorms, it is highly likely that we will be able to provide lunch. For students who find their own housing, they may bring their own lunch, or purchase lunch at nearby shops (for example, students usually go to Franklin Table)."
    // },
    {
        question: "How much mathematics or computer science are applicants expected to know?",
        answer: "A good understanding of Algebra 1 (or the equivalent) is all that is required. Those who wish to attend should be able to cope with a heavy work load."
    },
    {
        question: "Will there be any programming in the course?",
        answer: "No. Theoretical concepts are the main subject of study.  Laptops are  unnecessary for the duration of the program."
    },
    {
        question: "Will a textbook be used in the course?",
        answer: "For the most part, lecture notes will be handed out. Towards the end, students may begin learning Algorithms and will be using Algorithm Design, by Jon Kleinberg and Éva Tardos. Students will need to obtain this textbook on their own."
    },
    {
        question: "What type of work will students do?",
        answer: " Typically,  a 2-3 hour lecture will be given in the morning. During the afternoons, students have time to work on assigned homework (which is given at the end of each lecture) either independently or cooperatively with other students. These problem sets get increasingly difficult, but students who have finished all assigned work should talk to Dr. Gandhi. Also, guest lecturers will give talks on specific areas of theoretical computer science later on in the course."
    },
    {
        question: "Do students have to be present on days when there are no lectures?",
        answer: "Yes. The students will have plenty of work to do and we expect them to come to the program venue and work on assigned problem sets. In the rare event that they are done with all of the assigned work, they should talk to Dr. Gandhi and he will assign them more work. Note that failure to not attend each day of the program (unless prior approval is taken from Dr. Gandhi) may result in termination of the student’s participation in the program."
    },
    {
        question: "What should applicants expect from this program?",
        answer: "Applicants should expect to work hard in this program. Students will be expected to master all the concepts that are taught to them.  They must also work diligently on their problem sets.  The main goal of any applicant to this program should be to have a desire to learn more about the world of mathematics and computer science.  If you are looking for a more relaxed setting, this program may not be the right option for you."
    },
    {
        question: "Do the students have to bring laptops?",
        answer: "No. We strongly discourage students from bringing electronic gadgets to the program. If they bring them then they should not use them during the program hours. We hold the right to confiscate electronic gadgets (and not return them), including cell phones if they are used during the program hours."
    },
    // {
    //     question: "How much does the program cost to a student?",
    //     answer: "The fee for PACT’22 summer program is $1850 ($1950 for international students). We do have limited scholarships available that will be used to support as many students as possible who are admitted but have financial constraints. Students will have to submit justification when requesting financial support."
    // },
    // {
    //     question: "How is Princeton University involved in this program?",
    //     answer: "Princeton University is in no way involved with this program except that it rents out space to PACT."
