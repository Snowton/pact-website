                These are not college students, though they are studying at a college campus, and learning material that is not normally taught until the undergraduate or even the graduate level.

                    <span class="big">While it is true </span>that computers and programming are a major part of modern computer science, the Program in Algorithmic and Combinatorial Thinking (PACT) – supported partially through the National Science Foundation – goes beyond that. The program teaches students about the mathematics and algorithms fundamental to the computer science field. Many summer programs teach high school students programming and application development, but this five-week intensive course is one of very few with a theoretical and proof-based emphasis.
